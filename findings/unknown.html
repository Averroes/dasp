		<p>Ethereum is still in its infancy. The main language used to develop smart contracts, Solidity, has yet to reach a stable version and the ecosystem's tools are still experimental. Some of the most damaging smart contract vulnerabilities surprised everyone, and there is no reason to believe there will not be another one that will be equally unexpected or equally destructive. As long as investors decide to place large amounts of money on complex but lightly-audited code, we will continue to see new discoveries leading to dire consequences. Methods of formally verifying smart contracts are not yet mature, but they seem to hold great promise as ways past today's shaky status quo. As new classes of vulnerabilities continue to be found, developers will need to stay on their feet, and new tools will need to be developed to find them before the bad guys do. This top 10 will likely evolve rapidly until smart contract development reaches a state of steadiness and maturity.</p>
